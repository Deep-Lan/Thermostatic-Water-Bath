# Thermostatic-Water-Bath

All types of temperature control products on the market are already very mature, such as refrigerators, air conditioners, thermostats, constant temperature water bath. But they are not smart enough. For example, they cannot be remotely controlled, the current working state cannot be remote access, and so on.

Take thermostatic water bath as an example, we design a temperature control system based on the idea of IoT. Data are transmitted by the Internet. Users can use mobile phone to control temperature control system whenever and wherever if only the system is in the network environment. At the same time, temperature data are displayed on the screen. In this way, intelligent can be realized. Fig.1 shows our system.
